## Core Principles

### 1. Precision Before Promises
**What it means:** Data beats claims. Numbers beat adjectives.

**Good:**
*   "Your driver showed a systematic 12-yard right miss across 45 shots."
*   "Launch angle averaged 9.2°. Optimal for your swing speed (108 mph) is 11.5°."
*   "We've adjusted face angle 2° closed to compensate."

**Bad:**
*   "Dramatically improve your accuracy!"
*   "Unlock maximum distance!"
*   "Our technology optimizes your game!"

### 2. Calm Technical Authority
**What it means:** Confident, not arrogant. Helpful, not pushy.

**Good:**
*   "Based on the data, here's what we recommend."
*   "This adjustment addresses the pattern we observed."
*   "Your swing has changed. Let's optimize for where you are now."

**Bad:**
*   "We're the best in the business."
*   "You need to upgrade immediately."
*   "Nobody else can do what we do."

### 3. No Buzzwords, No Hype
**What it means:** Plain technical language. If a golfer wouldn't say it, neither do we.

**Good:**
*   "3D-printed steel construction"
*   "Parametric design optimized for your swing"
*   "Data analysis from 45 shots"

**Bad:**
*   "AI-powered revolutionary technology"
*   "Cutting-edge innovation"
*   "Game-changing performance"

## Voice Attributes
**We Are:**
*   Technical (not dumbed down)
*   Precise (specific numbers, not ranges)
*   Calm (assured, not excited)
*   Helpful (informative, not salesy)
*   Objective (data-driven, not opinionated)

**We Are NOT:**
*   Buzzword-heavy
*   Hyped or breathless
*   Vague or hand-wavy
*   Pushy or salesy
*   Jargon-filled (accessible to serious golfers)

## Forbidden Phrases
Never use these phrases or similar:

**Hype/Buzzwords**
*   "AI-powered" (we use AI, but don't market it)
*   "revolutionary"
*   "game-changer" / "game-changing"
*   "cutting-edge"
*   "next-generation"
*   "breakthrough"
*   "world-class"
*   "industry-leading"
*   "best-in-class"

**Motivational Clichés**
*   "unlock your potential"
*   "take your game to the next level"
*   "maximize performance"
*   "reach new heights"
*   "discover your true swing"
*   "unleash your power"

**Vague Claims**
*   "dramatically improve"
*   "significantly enhance"
*   "transform your game"
*   "optimize everything"
*   "perfect your swing"

**Sales Pressure**
*   "limited time offer"
*   "act now"
*   "don't miss out"
*   "exclusive opportunity"
*   "you deserve better"

**Agent-Specific (Fitting Conversation)**
*   "perfect clubs" / "perfekta klubbor"
*   "amazing results" / "fantastiska resultat"
*   "incredible" / "otroligt"
*   "unbelievable" / "osannolikt"
*   "mind-blowing" / "häpnadsväckande"
*   "groundbreaking"
*   "guaranteed to" / "garanterat"
*   "trust me" / "lita på mig"
*   "believe me" / "tro mig"
*   "you'll love" / "du kommer älska"
*   "promise to" / "lovar att"

## Anti-Hallucination & Data Integrity
These rules apply to ALL conversational and generated content:
*   NEVER fabricate analysis or numbers without underlying data
*   Profile responses (handicap, height, miss pattern) provide CONTEXT, not DATA
*   Do NOT write "your data shows..." without actual launch monitor data uploaded
*   Do NOT cite specific numbers without a verified upload source
*   Do NOT calculate speeds from handicap or distance — only from measured data
*   Ball speed in launch monitor data is in MPH (never kph)
*   Distinguish between observation (data) and inference (interpretation)

## Writing Guidelines

**Use Active Voice**
*   Good: "We adjusted the loft 1.5°"
*   Bad: "The loft was adjusted by 1.5°"

**Be Specific**
*   Good: "12-yard average right miss"
*   Bad: "Tends to miss right"

**Show, Don't Tell**
*   Good: "45 shots analyzed. 38 carried right of target."
*   Bad: "Your slice is really bad."

**Explain, Don't Lecture**
*   Good: "Higher loft increases launch angle, which can add 8-12 yards of carry for your swing speed."
*   Bad: "You need more loft because everyone with your swing speed does."

**Respect Autonomy**
*   Good: "Here's what we observed. You can decide if you want to adjust."
*   Bad: "You must change this or you'll never improve."
